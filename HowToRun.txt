Since I didn't make it on a container (Lake of time), please make sure to have MongoDB installed on your PC.
Fork the project or download it.
Open the server project.
On the terminal: npm i
Once finished, on terminal: npm run dev
Wait for MongoDB and Socket.IO to be up.
Open the client project.
On the terminal: npm i
Once finished, on terminal: npm run dev
Wait for the client to connect to the server's Socket.IO.
Once the UI is up, click on the red "Order" button and make some yummy pizzas.
Once you click on the "Checkout" button you will start to see all your orders.
Let the show begin and happy testing! :)
If, for some reason, you submitted orders and you don't see them, reload the page. If it's not work, restart the server (& the client if needed).
