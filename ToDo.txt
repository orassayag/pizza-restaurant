So what I would do If I have more time for this project?
Well (Of course, put all on a docker, but besides that):

SERVER:
=======
ToDo:
# All the ToDo points I wrote around the project.
# Validation on the order from the client (Using Joi for example).
# Implement a scheduler to retry on all orders that for some reason are in the stage of PENDING or ERROR.
# Move all settings to config file.
# Better structure of the TypeScript (Reduce places of "any").
# Unit test / Integration tests.

CLIENT:
=======
ToDo:
# Add useCallback and useMemo for the relevant places.
# Load all toppies and sizes from the server.
# Fix the script bug (In the console).
# Add loader if not connected yet.
# If no orders - Display a message of no orders.
# Move all settings to config file.
# Add yup Validation to order (User).
# Handle errors from the server.
# Add redux-toolkit for better state management.
# When disconnected and have orders - Display a message.
# Unit test / Integration tests.
# Add prop-types for each component.
# Add the user details modal + Add yup Validation:
